# CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance

## Project Overview
This repository contains coursework and projects for **CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance**. This project aims to implement and demonstrate best practices in software testing, focusing on **unit testing, automation, and quality assurance methodologies**.

Through this project, I explored techniques to enhance software reliability, maintainability, and efficiency, ensuring that applications meet high-quality standards.

## Key Questions & Approaches

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Ensuring software functionality and security requires a structured approach to **testing, code review, and best development practices**. One of the most effective methods I used in this project is **white-box testing**, which involves analyzing the internal structure of the code to verify that each component behaves as expected.

Other key strategies include:
- Writing **clear, maintainable, and well-documented code** to enhance readability and ease of debugging.
- Regularly reviewing code to **eliminate redundant or unused code**, which helps improve efficiency and reduces potential security risks.
- Leveraging **automated testing frameworks** to systematically validate functionality and detect errors before deployment.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Understanding and implementing user requirements is a fundamental aspect of software development. My approach includes:
1. **Carefully analyzing the given specifications** to identify key functional and non-functional requirements.
2. **Breaking down complex requirements into smaller, manageable tasks** to ensure thorough implementation.
3. Implementing constraints such as:
   - **Phone number, ID length, and name fields are limited to 10 characters.**
   - Using a **final byte of length 10** to enforce these restrictions programmatically.
   
By systematically addressing user needs and enforcing clear validation rules, I ensured that the software met its intended requirements precisely.

### How do I approach designing software?
Developing software requires careful planning, structured execution, and continuous refinement. My process follows these steps:

1. **Requirement Analysis:** Understanding the specifications and defining core functionalities.
2. **Task Breakdown:** Dividing requirements into distinct components to streamline development.
3. **Initial Implementation:** Writing the foundational code to achieve the primary functionality.
4. **Refinement & Debugging:** Iteratively improving the code for efficiency, readability, and correctness.
5. **Final Verification:** Conducting thorough reviews and testing to ensure all requirements are met.

By following this approach, I ensure that my software is not only functional but also **well-structured, scalable, and maintainable**.

    ''' bash
    mvn clean install

### If using Gradle:
    ''' bash
    gradle build

## Run the tests
### For Maven:
    ''' bash
    mvn test

### For Gradle:
    ''' bash
    gradle test

## Usage
This project includes a collection of test cases and testing techniques that can be executed to validate the functionality of different software components. The test results can be analyzed using code coverage tools and logs generated by automated test scripts.
Example command to run tests with detailed output:

    ''' bash
    mvn test -Dtest=TestClassName
or

    ''' bash
    gradle test -Dtest=TestClassName

## Best Practices Implemented
### Automated Testing & CI/CD
- Test automation integrated with GitHub Actions.
- Automatic build validation before merging code into the main branch.

### Quality Assurance Techniques
- Use of test doubles *mocking, stubs) for unit testing.
- Ensuring 80%+ test coverage for critical components

## Lessons Learned & Challeneges 
Throughout this project, I explored real-world testing scenarios, faced challenges in implementing mock testing, and improved my ability to debug and refine software through iterative testing.

## Key takeaways
* Writing scalable code improves maintainability
* CI/CD integration ensures smooth development workflows
* Automated testing significantly reduces human errors
