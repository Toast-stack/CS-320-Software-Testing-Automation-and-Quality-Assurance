# CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance

## Project Overview
This repository contains coursework and projects for **CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance**. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate fundamental and advanced techniques in software testing, including unit testing, automation, and quality assurance best practices.

Through this project, I have implemented and documented various testing methodologies to ensure software reliability, maintainability, and performance.

---

## Features
- Unit Testing: Implementation of test cases using JUnit.
- Test-Driven Development (TDD): Development following the TDD approach to ensure code correctness.
- Automated Testing: Utilization of automated test frameworks to streamline testing processes.
- Code Coverage Analysis: Measuring the effectiveness of test cases using coverage tools.
- Bug Tracking & Debugging: Identifying, logging, and fixing software defects.
- Continuous Integration (CI/CD): Integration of automated testing into a CI/CD pipeline.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Testing Framework:** JUnit
- **Build & Dependency Management:** Maven/Gradle
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **CI/CD Tools:** GitHub Actions (or other CI/CD tools if applicable)

## Installation & Setup
To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository:

    ''' bash
    git clone https://github.com/Toast-stack/CS-320-Software-Testing-Automation-and-Quality-Assurance.git
    cd CS-320-Software-Testing-Automation-and-Quality-Assurance

### Build the project

### If using Maven:
    ''' bash
    mvn clean install

### If using Gradle:
    ''' bash
    gradle build

## Run the tests
### For Maven:
    ''' bash
    mvn test

### For Gradle:
    ''' bash
    gradle test

## Usage
This project includes a collection of test cases and testing techniques that can be executed to validate the functionality of different software components. The test results can be analyzed using code coverage tools and logs generated by automated test scripts.
Example command to run tests with detailed output:

    ''' bash
    mvn test -Dtest=TestClassName
or

    ''' bash
    gradle test -Dtest=TestClassName

## Best Practices Implemented
### Automated Testing & CI/CD
- Test automation integrated with GitHub Actions.
- Automatic build validation before merging code into the main branch.

### Quality Assurance Techniques
- Use of test doubles *mocking, stubs) for unit testing.
- Ensuring 80%+ test coverage for critical components

## Lessons Learned & Challeneges 
Throughout this project, I explored real-world testing scenarios, faced challenges in implementing mock testing, and improved my ability to debug and refine software through iterative testing.

## Key takeaways
* Writing scalable code improves maintainability
* CI/CD integration ensures smooth development workflows
* Automated testing significantly reduces human errors
