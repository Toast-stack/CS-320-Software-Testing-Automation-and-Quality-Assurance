# CS-320-Software-Testing-Automation-and-Quality-Assurance


    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
One thing I can think is to use things like white-box testing and making sure to check over every line of code that was written in this case, other things that help during this is to use industry best practices such as keeping the code easy to understand and read, as well as making sure there aren't any unused bits of code that could make it harder to understand or make the software or code look worse.
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The first thing that I did when considering the requirements was to read over them carefully and make note of things that were expected and needed for them to function properly, I broke them down into smaller tasks to make sure they were taken care of. One of the aspects that I did this with is the restrictions that were placed on the phone number, ID length, First name, and last name length all being only allowed 10 characters. The way I accomplished this was to use a final byte with a length of 10 and test against it for all of the above variables.
    
    How do I approach designing software?
When trying to develop software I make sure to take into account the requirements that are laid before me and make sure I split them into their separate tasks to not forget them as I am coding other parts of it. With these done, I begin to code and make my code until it works, once the code works and accomplishes most of what I was asked, I get back to my code and begin to refine the things that either didn't work exactly as was asked or didn't look clean enough for me. After everything, I go back and make sure that all of my requirements are there and fill in all the things that were missing.
